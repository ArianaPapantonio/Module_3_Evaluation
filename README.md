# 📊 Final Evaluation – Module 3: Data Transformation & Statistical Analysis

This project is the **final evaluation for Module 3** of the Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp.  
The goal is to apply **data cleaning, transformation, visualization,** and **statistical analysis** techniques using customer data from an airline's loyalty program.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and clean raw data (missing values, outliers, duplicates)
- Transform variables, filter/group data, and derive new columns
- Create meaningful visualizations to detect trends and relationships
- Perform statistical tests (hypothesis testing)
- Compare flight booking patterns by education level

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The analysis uses two CSV files:

1. `Customer_Flight_Analysis.csv`  
   Includes flight activity, distances, loyalty points, and costs.

2. `Customer_Loyalty_History.csv`  
   Contains customer demographics, education, income, card type, and more.

## 🔍 Project Phases

### 📂 Phase 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning

- Initial inspection and assessment of nulls, outliers, data types
- Column transformations and consistent formatting
- Final cleaned dataset for analysis

### 📊 Phase 2: Visualization

Visualizations created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:

- Monthly flight booking distribution
- Relationship between distance and earned points
- Salary comparison by education level
- Customer segmentation by marital status, gender, and card type

### 🧪 Phase 3: Statistical Testing

- Grouped data by education level and flight bookings
- Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, std dev)
- Performed hypothesis testing to detect significant differences (A/B test)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **SciPy** – hypothesis testing and inferential statistics
